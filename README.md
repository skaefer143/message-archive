# Love Letter Archive - Store and search through important messages!
Let's face it: You use a lot of different messaging platforms. And you might have met 
a special somebody on one of these platforms. Wouldn't you want to easily search and 
filter through all of these important messages that you care about? 

Is it just me?

Well, sometimes you just gotta build it yourself.

## Description 
I want to store and search through SMS messages and Facebook Messenger messages that my wife and I 
sent each other when we were first dating. The idea is to be able to display useful stats,
as well as display some fancy interactive graphs.

I'll probably end up using a frontend framework for the UI, just cause I want to learn more 
about using React haha. 

It'll be fun!

## To Run
Run with normal Django runserver command.

`python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
